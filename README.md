# MOTHER script is the GENERATOR of PERSISTENCE FILES

Then, the CHILDREN scripts, MASTER and RECEIVER can be run on the MOTHER--generated PERSISTENCE FILES.

# The REPO begins with a MOTHER session 0 PERSISTENCE FILES generated and copied to the respective CHILDREN folders.

To begin the experiment: 
* Download the repository. 
* Open either the MASTER or RECEIVER subfolder
* If MASTER, run according to MASTER protocol
* If RECIEVER, run according to RECEIVER protocol
* The Session 0 MOTHER--generated PERSISTENCE FILES will now be OVERWRITTEN by the new CHILD-GENERATED data
* Take your CHILD--generated session data and compare to the opposite SIBLING's data (so, if MASTER, compare to RECEIVER, and if RECEIVER, compare to MASTER--generated data).
* Load combined data into ANALYSIS subfolder and run the analysis script
